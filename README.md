1. Objective:  
   The objective of the game is to place bets on different outcomes of a roulette spin, such as specific numbers, colors, or odd/even numbers, and win prizes based on the accuracy of the predictions.

2. Initialization:  
   Players start with an initial fund of their choosing, which they can use to place bets throughout the game.

3. Roulette Wheel:  
   The game simulates a roulette wheel, which contains a set of numbers and their associated colors (red or black). The wheel is spun to determine the winning outcome.

4. Betting Options:  
   Players have three types of bets to choose from:
   - Number Bet: Players bet on a specific number ranging from 0 to 36. If the chosen number matches the winning number, the player wins a payout of 36 times the bet amount.
   - Color Bet: Players bet on whether the winning number will be red or black. If the color prediction matches the winning color, the player wins a payout of double the bet amount.
   - Odd/Even Bet: Players bet on whether the winning number will be odd or even. If the prediction aligns with the parity of the winning number, the player wins a payout of double the bet amount.

5. Placing Bets:  
   Players choose the type of bet they want to place and the amount they wish to bet. They then enter their chosen parameters (number, color, or odd/even) based on the selected bet type.

6. Winning and Losing:  
   After placing a bet, the roulette wheel is spun, and the winning outcome is determined. If the player's bet matches the winning outcome, they receive a payout based on the specific bet type. If the bet is unsuccessful, the player loses the bet amount.

7. Funds Management:  
   Players' funds are updated after each bet, and they can monitor their current fund balance as well as their last fund balance.

8. Game Continuation:  
   Players have the option to continue playing by placing additional bets or to stop playing altogether. They can make this decision after each round of betting.

9. User Interface:  
   The game provides a simple text-based interface where players can input their betting choices and view game outcomes.

10. Conclusion:  
    The game offers an engaging and interactive experience where players can test their luck and strategy in predicting roulette outcomes, aiming to accumulate winnings and manage their funds effectively throughout the gameplay.
